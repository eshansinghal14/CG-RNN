Coarse graining for molecular dymamics ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.11412))

Dependencies
------------
Required:
+ `numpy`
+ `pytorch` (1.2 or higher)
+ `scipy`

Optional:
+ `mdtraj` (for `cgnet.molecule` only)
+ `pandas` (for `cgnet.molecule` only)
+ `sklearn` (for testing)
+ `Jupyter` (for `examples`)
+ `matplotlib` (for `examples`)

Usage
-----
Clone the repository:
```
git clone git@github.com:coarse-graining/cgnet.git
```

Install any missing dependencies, and then run:
```
cd cgnet
python setup.py install
```

Notes
-----
For compatibility with `pytorch==1.1`, please use the `pytorch-1.1` branch. This branch currently does not include the updates for variable size and Langevin dynamics, nor some normalization options.
```diff
- CGnet models can display high variance between different training runs. For more stable models, we recommend using CGSchNet instead.
